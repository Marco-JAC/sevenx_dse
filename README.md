> **sevenx_dse** is a downstream fork of [AdminNeo](https://www.adminneo.org/) embedded as a native eZ Publish Legacy extension — delivering raw SQL access, table browsing, schema inspection, import/export, and multi-driver database support (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL) directly inside the Exponential Platform Legacy admin interface, scoped behind eZ Publish role-based permissions.

## Project Notice

> "Please Note: This project is not associated with the original eZ Publish software or its original developer, eZ Systems."

sevenx_dse is an independent, 7x-driven extension for Exponential (100% eZ Publish Compatible). It embeds [AdminNeo](https://www.adminneo.org/) — a downstream fork of the original Adminer database tool — as a fully integrated module inside the legacy admin UI. The extension is stewarded by [7x (se7enx.com)](https://se7enx.com).

---

## Project Status

**sevenx_dse 1.0.x is the current stable release line.**

The extension is under active development targeting Exponential Platform Legacy 6.x / eZ Publish 5.x with PHP 8.3+. Ongoing work focuses on:

- Stable embedding of AdminNeo 5.x inside the eZ Publish admin3 design
- Multi-driver support: MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL
- Session-safe gate and CSRF-protected database switching
- CSS isolation to prevent AdminNeo global styles from damaging eZ admin chrome
- Export/download passthrough without eZ template wrapping
- PHP 8.3 and 8.5 compatibility

---

## What is sevenx_dse?

sevenx_dse is a direct database source editor for Exponential Platform Legacy. It embeds the full [AdminNeo](https://www.adminneo.org/) database UI as a native eZ Publish module, accessible at `/dse/dashboard` inside the eZ admin interface.

### What Does sevenx_dse Provide?

- **Raw SQL execution** — run arbitrary queries against the live database
- **Table browsing** — browse, filter, sort, and paginate table rows
- **Schema inspection** — view table structure, indexes, foreign keys
- **Data import/export** — SQL dump, CSV, TSV export and import with direct download passthrough (no eZ template wrapping)
- **Multi-driver support** — MySQL/MariaDB, SQLite, PostgreSQL
- **Safety gate** — mandatory disclaimer + backup acknowledgement screen on every bare access
- **CSRF-protected database switching** — "Change database" link uses a per-session token
- **Session-aware** — preserves AdminNeo server sessions (`$_SESSION['pwds']`) across gate acknowledgement
- **Permission-gated** — access controlled by eZ Publish role policy (`dse/dashboard`)
- **CSS-isolated** — AdminNeo's global stylesheet rules are neutralised so they cannot damage eZ admin chrome

### Access URL

```
/dse/dashboard
```

### The dashboard

Opening `/dse/dashboard` from the menu shows the dashboard first, in the look of the other Exponential
administration pages (light and dark): what the editor does, the warning, the site's database (type, name, table
count, server version, AdminNeo version; never credentials), what can be done with it, how it is kept safe (the
policy, the login, SQLite paths, remembered logins, a warning when `dse.ini [DSESettings] InsecureUse` is enabled),
and the acknowledgement that opens AdminNeo. Nothing connects before that.

- Template: `design/standard/templates/dse/gate.tpl` with its styles in `dse/exp_style.tpl`; `dse/dashboard.tpl`
  prints it without AdminNeo's styles and scripts. An override of `dse/dashboard.tpl` that prints `$neo_body` still
  shows a working dashboard.
- The form posts `dse_ack_warning=1` to the same address, as before.
- When the browser sends no language and none was chosen in AdminNeo, AdminNeo uses the administration's language
  instead of its first translation.
