 * DSE AdminNeo endpoint — raw AdminNeo output, no eZ pagelayout.

 * This view is loaded inside an <iframe> by dse/dashboard. It runs AdminNeo
 * directly under Exponential's authentication/access-control layer. AdminNeo
 * outputs a complete HTML document; eZExecution::setCleanExit() prevents the
 * eZ shutdown handler from treating the exit() as an error.
 *
 * DB credentials are read from site.ini by adminneo/adminneo-config.php,
 * which AdminNeo's Origin::create() loads automatically.
