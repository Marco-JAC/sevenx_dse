 * DSE Dashboard — embeds AdminNeo database editor inside the eZ admin layout.
 *
 * AdminNeo is captured via ob_start() and its <body> content is injected into
 * the eZ template as $neo_body. Static CSS/JS are loaded from design/standard.
 * AdminNeo's exit() calls are replaced with EzExit exceptions so control
 * returns here after AdminNeo finishes rendering.
